REST API for Roundup

Introduction
------------

After the last 1.6.0 Release, a REST-API developed in 2015 during a Google
Summer of Code (GSOC) by Chau Nguyen, supervised by Ezio Melotti was
integrated. The code was then updated by John Rouillard and Ralf
Schlatterbeck to fix some shortcomings and provide the necessary
functions for a single page web application, e.g. etag support among
others.

Enabling the REST API
---------------------

The REST API can be disabled in the ``[web]`` section of ``config.ini``
via the variable ``enable_rest`` which is ``yes`` by default.

The REST api is reached via the ``/rest/`` endpoint of the tracker URL.


Client API
----------

The top-level REST url ``/rest/`` will display the current version of
the REST API (Version 1 as of this writing) and some links to relevant
endpoints of the API. In the following the ``/rest`` prefix is ommitted
from relative REST-API links for brevety.

Summary
=======

A Summary page can be reached via ``/data/summary`` via the ``GET`` method.
This is currently hard-coded for the standard tracker schema shipped
with roundup and will display a summary of open issues.

Data
====

All the links mentioned in the following support the http method ``GET``. 
Results of a ``GET`` request will always return the results as a
dictionary with the entry ``data`` referring to the returned data.

The ``/data`` link will display a set of classes of the tracker. All
classes can be reached via ``/data/<classname>`` where ``<classname>``
is replace with the name of the class to query, e.g. ``/data/issue``.
Individual items of a class (e.g. a single issue) can be queried by
giving the issue-id, e.g., ``/data/issue/42``. Individual properties of
an item can be queried by appending the property, e.g.,
``/data/issue/42/title``.

When performing the ``GET`` method on a class (e.g. ``/data/issue``), the
number of items is returned in ``@total_size``. Then a ``collection``
list follows which contains the id and link to the respective item.
This endpoint supports pagination. With the attributes @page_size and
@page_index, pagination is controlled. The @page_size specifies how many
items are displayed at once. The @page_index (which defaults to 1 if not
given) specifies which page number of @page_size items is displayed. If
no @page_size is specified, all items are returned.
In addition this method supports searching. Search parameters are names
of properties of the given class, e.g., ``status`` for ``issue``. Links
and Multilinks can be specified numerically or symbolically, e.g.,
searching for issues in status ``closed`` can be achieved by searching
for ``status=closed`` or ``status=3`` (provided the ``closed`` status
has ID 3). Note that searching for strings (e.g. the issue title)
performs a case-insensitive substring search, so searching for
title=Something will find all issues with "Something" or "someThing",
etc. in the title. There is currently no way to perform an exact string
match.

When performing the ``GET`` method on an item (e.g. ``/data/issue/42``), a
``link`` attribute contains the link to the item, ``id`` contains the
id, type contains the class name (e.g. ``issue`` in the example) and an
``etag`` property can be used to detect modifications since the last
query. The individual properties of the item are returned in an
``attributes`` dictionary. The properties returned depend on the
permissions of the account used for the query.
Link and Multilink properties are displayed as a dictionary with a link
and an id property by default. This is controlled by the @verbose
attribute which is set to 1 by default. If set to 0, only the id is
shown for Link and Multilink attributes. If set to 2, the label property
(usually ``name`` e.g. for status) is also put into the dictionary.
Content properties of message and file object are by default also shown
as a dictionary with a sole link attribute. The link is the download
link for the file or message. If @verbose is >= 3, the content property
is shown in json as a (possibly very long) string. Currently the json
serializer cannot handle files not properly utf-8 encoded, so specifying
@verbose=3 for files is currently discouraged.

A ``GET`` method on a property (e.g. ``/data/issue/42/title``) returns the
link, an ``@etag``, the type of the property (e.g. "<type str>") the id
of the item and the content of the property in ``data``.

Only class links support the ``POST`` method for creation of new items
of a class, e.g., a new issue via the ``/data/issue`` link. The post
gets a dictionary of keys/values for the new item. It returns the same
parameters as the GET method after successful creation.

All endpoints support an ``OPTIONS`` method for determining which
methods are allowed on a given endpoint.

The method ``PUT`` is allowed on individual items, e.g.
``/data/issue/42`` as well as properties, e.g.,
``/data/issue/42/title``. On success it returns the same parameters as
the respective ``GET`` method. Note that for ``PUT`` an Etag has to be
supplied, either in the request header or as an @etag parameter.

The method ``DELETE`` is allowed on items, e.g., ``/data/issue/42`` and
will retire (mark as deleted) the respective item. On success it will
only return a status code. It is also possible to call ``DELETE`` on a
property of an item, e.g., ``/data/issue/42/nosy`` to delete the nosy
list. The same effect can be achieved with a ``PUT`` request and an
empty new value.

Finally the ``PATCH`` method can be applied to individual items, e.g.,
``/data/issue/42`` and to properties, e.g., ``/data/issue/42/title``.
This method gets an operator ``@op=<method>`` where ``<method`` is one
of ``add``, ``replace``, ``remove``, only for an item (not for a
property) an additional operator ``action`` is supported. If no operator
is specified, the default is ``replace``. The first three operators are
self explanatory. For an ``action`` operator an ``@action_name`` and
optional ``@action_argsXXX`` parameters have to be supplied. Currently
there are only two actions without parameters, namely ``retire`` and
``restore``. The ``retire`` action on an item is the same as a
``DELETE`` method, it retires the item. The ``restore`` action is the
inverse of ``retire``, the item is again visible.
On success the returned value is the same as the respective ``GET``
method.

Note that the ``GET`` method on an item (e.g. ``/data/issue/43``)
returns an ETag in the http header *and* the ``@etag`` value. When
modifying the item via ``PUT`` or ``PATCH`` either a ``If-Match`` header
or an ``@etag`` value in the form have to be provided.

sample python client
====================

The client uses the python ``requests`` library for easier interaction
with a REST API supporting JSON encoding::


        >>> import requests
        >>> u = 'http://user:password@tracker.example.com/demo/rest/data/'
        >>> s = requests.session()
        >>> r = s.get(u + 'issue/42/title')
        >>> if r.status_code != 200:
        ...     print("Failed: %s: %s" % (r.status_code, r.reason))
        ...     exit(1)
        >>> print (r.json() ['data']['data']
        TEST Title
        >>> r = s.post (u + 'issue', data = dict (title = 'TEST Issue'))
        >>> if not 200 <= r.status_code <= 201:
        ...     print("Failed: %s: %s" % (r.status_code, r.reason))
        ...     exit(1)
        >>> print(r.json())

Retire/Restore::
        >>> r = s.delete (u + 'issue/42')
        >>> print (r.json())
        >>> r = s.get (u + 'issue/42')
        >>> etag = r.headers['ETag']
        >>> print("ETag: %s" % etag)
        >>> etag = r.json()['data']['@etag']
        >>> print("@etag: %s" % etag)
        >>> h = {'If-Match': etag}
        >>> d = {'@op:'action', '@action_name':'retire'}
        >>> r = s.patch(u + 'issue/42', data = d, headers = h)
        >>> print(r.json())
        >>> d = {'@op:'action', '@action_name':'restore'}
        >>> r = s.patch(u + 'issue/42', data = d, headers = h)
        >>> print(r.json())
