Read-only Access
----------------

Read-only repository access is provided through ::

  hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code roundup-code

The URL for the webinterface works, too, but you will see messages about
redirects to the URL shown here.

Read-write Access
-----------------

The read/write access uses your SourceForge.net ssh password or ssh key
to authorize your access. (See `SF's site documentation on Mercurial access
<https://sourceforge.net/p/forge/documentation/Mercurial/>`_) ::

  hg clone ssh://USERNAME@hg.code.sf.net/p/roundup/code roundup-code

Of course a roundup developer must have granted
you write access first - ask for it on the roundup-devel list.
