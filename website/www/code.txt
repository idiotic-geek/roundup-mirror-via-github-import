Changelog
----------

The changelog is available as `CHANGES.txt in the SCM repository <http://roundup.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/roundup/roundup/raw-file/default/CHANGES.txt>`_.

Browse
------

You may browse the repository via the `Mercurial webinterface <http://roundup.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/roundup/roundup>`_.

Read-only Access
----------------

Read-only repository access is provided through ::

  hg clone http://roundup.hg.sourceforge.net:8000/hgroot/roundup/roundup

The URL for the webinterface works, too, but you will see messages about
redirects to the URL shown here.

Read-write Access
-----------------

The read/write access uses your SourceForge.net ssh password or ssh key
to authorize your access. (See `SF's site documentation on Mercurial access
<https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Mercurial#Access>`_) ::

  hg clone ssh://<username>@roundup.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/roundup/roundup

Of course a roundup developer must have granted
you write access first - ask for it on the roundup-devel list.
