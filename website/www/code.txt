Code
====

Roundup is an open source project written in Python, so we use
SourceForge and Mercurial to keep in the same spirits. But when
practicality beats purity, you may also find unoffical
mirrors like
`this one on GitHub <https://github.com/roundup-tracker/roundup>`_.

Project history is maintained in `CHANGES.txt <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/tip/tree/CHANGES.txt>`_
file in code repository of Roundup, which can also be viewed online
through SourceForge `web interface <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/>`_.
